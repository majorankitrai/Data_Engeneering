# 2. __init__ is a constructor which allow us to create variables in class.

'''In Python, a constructor is a special method that is called when an instance (object) of a class
is created. The constructor method is
defined using the __init__ method. It allows you to initialize the object's attributes with specific values when the object is created.
'''

'''The primary use of a constructor is to initialize the attributes of a class when an object is created. 
This ensures that the object is in a valid state right from the start.'''
